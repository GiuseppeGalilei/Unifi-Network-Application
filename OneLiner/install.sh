Welcome to the installation script for Unifi Network Application.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This will deploy both the Unifi Network Application and MongoDB container, along with a bridge network to connect the two.

If you previously deployed containers unifi-db and unifi-network-application, they will be reinstalled.

Done!
The dashboard will be available soon on port 8443.

If you get error 404 do not worry, just wait a few more minutes for the dashboard to initialize.

IMPORTANT! After Install:
Because the network application runs inside Docker, by default it uses an IP address not accessible by other devices.
So, for it to adopt other devices, it is required to use port `8080` and change the inform IP address. To do so, go in settings and search for the `Inform Host` option, there select override and set the address to that of the host.
Often, it is also needed to SSH into the devices you want to adopt and manually set the inform IP address, the command needed for doing so is `set-inform http://HOST-ADDRESS:8080/inform`.
